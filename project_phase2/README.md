# Project phase 2
this project was about developing a model to enhance performance of Deep-DTA method. Deep-DTA is a method to predict target-drug binding and use 2 datasets.(kiba, davis)
I used pytorch geometry molecules of drugs and made a model using graph conv net. I also used embedding for proteins.The model had a better performance comparing to Deep-DTA.
I then used interpretation methods such as saliency maps and weighted grad-cam to gain understanding about how model trains and what it learns.
